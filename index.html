       Tristan Tzara/Dadaist Web Poem:
     </h2>
    <p>
      I'm imagining a keyboard, like the one I'm using to type, coded as a CSS element displayed on the screen. Rather than the usual letters, each key is a word (sourced from the contents of a book, an article, news feed available online). When you click on the word, the word is displayed on the screen above the keyboard, spoken aloud by the computer, and the word of the key you just pressed is replaced by another word. As you press along, the words you've clicked are saved and displayed as a passage.

       Bottom Trawling Youtube:
     </h2>
     <p>
       The iceberg is a popular metaphor on youtube for describing the vast amounts of content available to us. Its spurred a number of channels to do "deep dives" into their content of choice. Whether it be a popular game franchise, a cult film, a conspiracy theory, etc -- chances are someone's made an iceberg out of your favorite passtime. 
       <br><br> My interest in this metaphor is in the way it gives form to the largely dispersed, ephemeral bodies of content that we access on the internet. In its most basic sense, the iceberg metaphor presents us with a peak -- that is, content that has a certain surplus relevance, something we might be familiar with but not know all that well. By contrast, the depths -- that which exists below the surface of relevance, is obscured, only pulled back to us by these deep sea explorers with the time and resources to do the research. 
       <br><br>Similarly, I'm interested in the depths of the platforms we exist in. My experience as a consumer of youtube is vastly different from my experience as a producer of youtube. I've uploaded videos, art works to the platform before, but the videos rarely get more than a handful of views. Meanwhile, as a consumer of youtube, I seem to only be presented with videos that fall above this surface of relevant content. It seemed possible to me that most of the content uploaded to youtube might actually exist in these depths, with a view count so low that youtube might never recommend it.
       <br><br> What I'd like to do is find a more tangible way of grasping these depths. I'm imagining the interior of a submarine, maybe coded in a 3D space like A-frame, with portholes on each side. You have a lever of some sort, which allows you to control the depth of the vessel. Changing your depth means changing the view count. As you descend, you are presented with videos in each porthole with fewer and fewer views. As you ascend, you'll likewise be met with the videos with greater and greater views.
